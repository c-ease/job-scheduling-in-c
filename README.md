Disk scheduling algorithms implemented in c language: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN C-SCAN
for refernce- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/

Basically these c programs simulates the disk scheduling and must be given input while keeping in mind the following format:
1. Number of disk blocks should be a positive integer with value < 200
2. number of requests must be a positive integer
3. the request string should be space-separated positive integers
4. the direction of head (if asked) must be either 0(left) or 1(right)
5. head position must be a positive integer
